    <p>Swedish has a specific word for each of the four grandparents: mormor, morfar, farmor, farfar.</p><p>English doesn’t. So when you mention your “grandma” to a Swede, they are left wondering “which grandma?” even if it is not relevant to the story.</p>

    <p>I did a few <a href="https://blog.sbensu.com/posts/friction-logs/">friction logs</a> for apps that integrate LLMs. In this post, I draw some common themes and lessons from them re their UI design.

    <p>Most software is bad. I neither know why, nor how to solve the problem. Instead, the best I have to offer is a technique to keep the badness away for a while: friction logs.</p><p>Friction logs are what they sound: a detailed log of everything that caused friction when using a product. This post teaches you how to make one. I recommend you to make one if:</p>

    <p>The statement "this company lacks focus" confuses me. Don't companies hire more people in order to do more things? Shouldn’t the number of things the company can "focus" on expand as you hire?</p><p>Clearly that is the case: Google has <a href="https://about.google/products/">100 products</a> more than any new startup could have. But if anything, 100 products seems too few; after all, they have 200k employees! For reference, Instagram launched with less than 13 people. If Google were as efficient as Instagram was, they "should have" 150x more products.</p>

    <p>When writing graphical user interfaces, the end user is a person. If the user interface changes overnight, the user might be surprised but they can adapt and react accordingly. Most software companies are used to changing their products often in various ways. API products don’t have this luxury.</p><p>APIs are used by programs which can’t adapt to change. So, whenever you change an API, the change should be <em>backwards compatible</em> so that the new API version can be used by existing integrations.

    <p>Every so often, somebody will tell me how crypto will render Visa and Mastercard obsolete. Crypto could do that one day but what we have today is not enough. Other people tell me that crypto is terrible, Visa is also terrible, and that payment fees should be absolutely zero. In both cases, when they run me through the logic, I often realize that they don't understand the difference between payments and transfers:</p><ul><li>A <strong>transfer</strong> is the simplest operation: you move money from account A to account B. They are usually irreversible<a href="#fn-1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> and in many cases, the same entity often controls both accounts. For example, you send money from your bank to your broker.</li><li>A <strong>payment</strong> is made in exchange for goods and services and it has an implicit contract associated. The rules of this implicit contract are codified in the payment network rules.</li></ul>
