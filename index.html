                <a class="link-highlight" href="/posts/design-for-support-teams/">Designing for support teams</a>. Support agents spend their entire lives using the same software. Their needs are very different from consumer software. Here are some things to keep in mind.

                <a class="link-highlight" href="/posts/friction-logs/">How to: friction logs</a>. Friction logs are a technique to improve your own products and understand others.

            <p>
                <a class="link-highlight" href="/posts/api-avoid-breaking-changes/">How to avoid breaking APIs</a>. The main trick is to design them with extension in mind so that you won&#39;t have to break them later.
            </p>
          
        
          
            <p>
                <a class="link-highlight" href="/posts/apis-as-ladders/">APIs as ladders</a>. APIs are hard to learn. If you think about the learning curve of your API, you can design one that works for beginners, novices, and experts.

            </p>
          
        
          
            <p>
                <a class="link-highlight" href="/posts/creative-kernels/">Creative kernels</a>. Artists can often trace entire pieces around one idea that drives everything else.
            </p>
          
        
          
            <p>
                <a class="link-highlight" href="/posts/arguments-battlefield/">The battlefield where arguments fight</a>. A lot of speech is about convincing others of what type of arguments have merit
            </p>
          
        
          
            <p>
                <a class="link-highlight" href="/posts/collapse/">Collapse: The Fall of the Soviet Union</a>. Notes from reading the book by Zubok
            </p>
          
        
          
            <p>
                <a class="link-highlight" href="/posts/pseudo-currencies/">The birth of a (pseudo) currency</a>. A dozen pseudo-currencies were issued in Argentina in 2002. How did that work? And why are they coming back in 2024?

            <p>
                <a class="link-highlight" href="/posts/twitter-sith/">Twitter&#39;s Sith and Jedi</a>. In Star Wars, hate gives the Sith power from the dark side of the Force beyond what the Jedi can reach. But when they lean into hate, they lose their soul to it. Twitter offers the same bargain as the Force.
            </p>
          
        
          
            <p>
                <a class="link-highlight" href="/posts/semantic-gaps/">Semantic gaps</a>. Swedish has a specific word for each of the four grandparents: mormor, morfar, farmor, farfar. English doesn’t. So when you mention your &#39;grandma&#39; to a Swede, they are left wondering &#39;which grandma?&#39; even if it is not relevant to the story. That is a semantic gap.
            </p>
          
        
          
            <p>
                <a class="link-highlight" href="/posts/payments-vs-transfers/">Payments vs Transfers</a>. Transfer means to move money but payment means &quot;exchanging goods or services&quot;. A payment system has a lot more requirements than a transfer system and I rarely see the crypto ecosystem acknowledge these when building &quot;payment&quot; products.
            </p>

                <a class="link-highlight" href="/posts/gift-card-marketplaces/">The secondary market in gift cards</a>. This post by patio11 covers a few things that I learned working with gift cards over the years.
