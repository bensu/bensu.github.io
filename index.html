    <p>When writing graphical user interfaces, the end user is a person. If the user interface changes overnight, the user might be surprised but they can adapt and react accordingly. Most software companies are used to changing their products often in various ways. API products don’t have this luxury.</p><p>APIs are used by programs which can’t adapt to change. So, whenever you change an API, the change should be <em>backwards compatible</em> so that the new API version can be used by existing integrations.  For a list of breaking changes one can make to JSON APIs, see <a href="/posts/2023-03-16-api-breaking-changes/">Breaking changes in JSON APIs</a>.</p>

    <p>Every so often, somebody will tell me how crypto will render Visa and Mastercard obsolete. Crypto could do that one day but what we have today is not enough. Other people tell me that crypto is terrible, Visa is also terrible, and that payment fees should be absolutely zero. In both cases, when they run me through the logic, I often realize that they don't understand the difference between payments and transfers:</p><ul><li>A <strong>transfer</strong> is the simplest operation: you move money from account A to account B. They are usually irreversible<a href="#fn-1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> and in many cases, the same entity often controls both accounts. For example, you send money from your bank to your broker.</li><li>A <strong>payment</strong> is made in exchange for goods and services and it has an implicit contract associated. The rules of this implicit contract are codified in the payment network rules.</li></ul>

    <p>Developers have opinions on what a good API<a href="#fn-1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> is, but rarely have a shared vocabulary to describe what makes them good. This essay puts forward one set of considerations (out of many) that we started using at Stripe in 2019 to discuss API design<a href="#fn-2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>. You can find some of these concepts interspersed in this excellent <a href="https://stripe.com/blog/payment-api-design">blogpost</a> by Michelle Bu.</p><p>The hard part of an API is not to use it, but to learn it. After learning how the API works, typing out the commands is not hard. But when you first time you encounter an API, a million questions pop into your mind: What is this object for? Is there a parameter for that? Can the API do X? Learning requires effort, but the more the developer learns, the more problems they can solve. We can imagine the developers climbing a ladder where, for every step they take up the “learning ladder”<a href="#fn-3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a>, the more problems they can solve.</p>
