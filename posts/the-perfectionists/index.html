    <p>I loved this <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Perfectionists-Precision-Engineers-Created-Modern/dp/0062652559/">book</a>! The author lays out the ideas that had to be invented for modern industry to work:</p><p><strong>Precision itself</strong>. We can make things precise and measure how precise they are. Before this idea, a bar was 100mm. Now a bar is 100mm -+ 0.1mm. This allowed early steam engines to avoid leaks in between those 0.1mm cracks. More than that, they invented all the different ways in which parts had to be precise (flatness, roundness, etc).</p><p>To get here, people had to invent what I'd call "precision amplifiers" or "precision levers". You start with something that can't know to be precise and find a way to construct something else that you do know to be precise. The nicest example is, to construct a flat plane, you need three planes. You rub them off each other in pairs until all three are super polished. If you had done this with two of them, the concavity of one could be the convexity of the other. But with three, it is impossible for the three to have complementary errors.</p><p><strong>Absolute precision</strong>. That bar was 100mm -+ 0.1mm when measured with respect to the hole it was going to fit in. If the hole was not 100mm, that was fine, what mattered was that the two fit together, not that they adhere to the 100mm "universal standard". A Swede invented gauge blocks to universally measure and sold his company to Henry Ford. Now, the bar has to be 100mm -+ 01.mm when measured by the gauge blocks. This allowed the next idea.</p><p><strong>Interchangeable parts</strong>. Parts used to be fitted with each other. So, if they were both off by the same 1mm, that was totally fine. But if you want to have interchangeable parts, they all need to be made to the universal standard because their individual errors are never going to compensate each other. The idea of absolute precision allowed for interchangeable parts.</p><p>Bonus: a French armory invented this concept but the French workers didn't like it, because it commoditized them. So they "unionized" and France continued to work without it.</p><p><strong>Standards</strong>. Once you have interchangeable parts inside of your factory, why not have them <em>across</em> factories? Henry Ford was making Model Ts before they fully understood this idea. They were buying Swedish ball bearings from SKS and got into a dispute: are the ball bearings to spec? SKS was measuring the ball bearings with gauge blocks, the Ford factory was measuring them with their own tools, which had drifted. At that moment, Ford decided to buy the gauge block company.</p><p>It is one of those books that leave you loving humanity! How hard it is to do the most basic of things, yet we do. </p><p>Thank you Grant Slatton for the recommendation!</p>
