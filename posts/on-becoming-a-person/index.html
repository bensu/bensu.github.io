    <p>Loved the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/-/es/Becoming-Person-Therapists-View-Psychotherapy/dp/1845290577/">book</a>! My interpretation:  </p><p>The underlying metaphor for therapy is medicine. The patient is a system with problems. Treatments will be applied to the patient to solve said problems. When the doctor prescribes cholesterol pills, they'll have the same effect regardless of who the doctor is.  </p><p>Rogers thinks that is a terrible metaphor. Instead, it is the relationship between the therapist and the client that matters:  </p><ul><li>A bad relationship can't help, even if it prescribes "the right treatment".</li><li>"Within the right relationship", any treatment will cure the patient because the actual treatment is to spend time with the therapist in the context of that therapeutic relationship.</li></ul><p>I have no experience with actual therapy so I can't judge if this is true. But it certainly resonates in terms of helping people with many of their problems. My relationship with certain people is set up in a way where I simply can't help with certain problems, no matter how much I try. It is a combination of they are, who I am, how they see me, how I see them, etc. The combo makes me totally ineffective. And with other people, otherwise very similar, I have a relationship where I can easily help with those same types of problems!  </p><p>It's the same with management (and possibly education<a href="#fn-1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>). The first months of working with someone, there are only certain things you can help them with. People round this down to "they gotta trust you" but it is more nuanced:  </p><ul><li>You have to earn their respect in each domain you want to help them<ul><li>They have to trust you to not judge them as they try</li><li>You have to care about them getting better at the skill </li></ul></li></ul><p>Most of the coaching side of management can only come after you have the right relationship. Same for the leading side. And the two sides require different relationships! For the distinction between these two, see <a href="/posts/team-oriented-vs-outcome-oriented/">Team-oriented vs outcome-oriented</a>  </p><p><br /></p><p><em>Thank you to Rinad for recommending this and many other great books.</em></p><p><br /></p><h1 id="footnotes">Footnotes</h1> <ol class="footnotes"><li id="fn-1">Priya Rose pointed out that Maria Montessori believed that her method couldn’t be applied by just anyone, and that the first step was essentially for the teacher to mature so they could be in right relationship with the student.<a href="#fnref1">↩</a></li></ol>
