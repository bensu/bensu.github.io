Backwards Emergent Behavior vs the Inner Compass

Apple presented its new iPad product line. Even TechCrunch noticed that 5 iPad types times 3 storage options, times 2 connectivity options (Wifi vs Wifi + Cell) might be “Too Many iPads”. What happened?

The iPad explosion baffled me. I have never bought an Apple product yet I have always observed the company from a distance. Like everybody else, I find them fascinating. I assume that everybody inside Apple (like everybody outside it) read Steve Jobs bio. One of the best scenes in the book is when Jobs comes back to Apple and outlines their entire product line strategy in two sentences[^1]: 

He drew a horizontal and vertical line to make a four-squared chart. “Here’s what we need,” he continued. Atop the two columns he wrote “Consumer” and “Pro”; he labeled the two rows “Desktop” and “Portable.” Their job, he said, was to make four great products, one for each quadrant.

When I read it, the simplicity of this strategy blew my mind. Isn't business supposed to be plagued with corporate strategy, price schemes, positioning, differentiation, etc.? Not in his head. That taught me that business can be simple if you make it so. Lesson learned.

That is what it surprises me. Didn't the execs at Apple learned as well? It is easy to see how those complex product lines arise. If we consider the product line as a product itself, then it is a product designed by a committee. In the same way committees members negotiate features of a product with one another, executives negotiate which products should make it into the next product line. To make everybody somewhat happy, committees tend to err on the side of “too  features,  little coherence”. Ditto for execs: “too  products,  little consistency”.

I am not smarter than the executives at Apple. They can also realize they are designing by committee and stop it. But they didn't stop it. We have now two options: assume they are dumb or assume that they did realized and continued anyway. Why would that happen?

A possibility is emergent behavior. Since I am no expert I can only explain emergent behavior like this: in an ant community, each individual ant is a  simple agent that follows  simple rules. No individual ant understands the concept "a path from the ant-hole to food" yet the interaction between the ants produces the paths. The ants can’t explain how it works but it does! [^2] The sum of the parts is smarter than the parts themselves, aka emergent behavior.

In the executives’ case, we also have emergent behavior but it works backwards. Everybody can understand what is going on and how damaging it is but they can’t stop themselves from doing it. They are much worse than the ants: they are walking away from the path and know about it. This "backwards emergent behavior" is the norm when it comes to product lines. All regular consumer electronics companies (which now include Apple) suffer from it. Of course, backwards emergent behavior is only a specific case of corporate politics.

I have little experience on corporate politics but I have read enough management books and Paul Graham essays[^4] to know how bad it can be. The naive question I ask is: does it have to be that way? Steve Jobs proved that it doesn't. He proved that you can run a business by using the simplest concepts and it works wonders. To eliminate the backwards emergent behavior in Apple in 97 it took one person to say what should be done. He also proved that this m.o. works *consistently*. When we read founder stories, there is always some cynical voice whispering to us: "they were lucky, they hit the lottery". That is not the case with Jobs. He has many home runs under his belt.

Elon Musk works in a similar way. Have you heard him talk about reasoning from first principles? The strategy behind each of his companies is dead simple: email payments, electric cars that are better than gasoline cars, and spaceships that are x10 cheaper. In my eyes he is the biggest entrepreneur alive. These strategies are outliers in the business world. Both Jobs and Musk proved they are the most effective. If they are simple and better why are they outliers?

Even though they are simple strategies, they defy our conception of what is possible and thus they are hard to conceive. But wait! As Peter Thiel keeps saying, this is true of most successful startups. If their core idea is not contrarian somebody would have already done it. Google, Facebook, and Amazon were contrarian when they started. But unlike Jobs or Musk, Page, Zuckerberg, and Bezos didn't do it several times.

So what is it about Elon Musk and Steve Jobs? Firstly, they do hardware. Might that be the difference? I suspect it is related. Once you ship hardware, it is permanent. If the release was bad, the product is doomed. It sounds obvious but it is not the case with software. You can correct bad software after releasing it[^3]. When designing software you can be tentative but when designing hardware you need to be decisive. To succeed in hardware, founders have an extra requirement: by the time of the release they should have the correct product. Not only that, since executing on a hardware design is much harder, they can't zigzag their way from vision to product a la Lean Startup. Then by induction, their vision for the product has to be accurate from the beginning. Then, they need to be right from the beginning *and* stick to their vision until the end.

To pull this off you need a rare inner compass that drives all of your decisions. This extends from the contrarian initial vision to everyday decisions like product lines or colors palettes. Those founders are unaffected by corporate politics or group thinking. Founders of great software startups are extraordinary but as it turns out, founders of great hardware startups have a little extra something.

The company was churning out multiple versions of each product because of bureaucratic momentum and to satisfy the whims of retailers.

[^2]: A subset of their behavior can be simulated with a few lines of code and then by having many ants interacting, paths to food magically appear even when nothing in your code considers them.
