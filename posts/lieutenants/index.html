    <p>You often hear "this company lacks focus". There is something weird about this statement. Don't companies hire more people in order to do more things? Shouldn’t the number of things the company can "focus" on expand as you hire?</p><p>In a naive way, this is certainly the case: Google has <a href="https://about.google/products/">100 products</a> more than any new startup could have.<br /></p><p>But if anything, 100 products seems too few; after all, they have 200k employees! For reference, Instagram launched with less than 13 people. It is absurd to use "focus" in the same way for Google and Instagram. If they were as efficient as Instagram was, Google "should have" 15,000 products, 150x more than what they have today.</p><p>What accounts for that difference? Why don't big tech companies ship more?</p><p>My working hypothesis is that the limiting reagent inside of big tech companies is "lieutenants": <strong>Effective</strong> people with high <strong>agency</strong> who are <strong>motivated</strong> to ship.</p><p>This definition seems obvious but most people don’t understand that it is their job to unblock themselves and that they don’t need permission to do whatever is needed. You need people who act even when they hit “extraordinary blockers”.</p><h2 id="extraordinary_blockers_are_routine">Extraordinary Blockers are routine</h2> Imagine the company wants to launch the product in India. The newly assembled team soon discovers that India requires user data to be stored in Indian servers. But today all data is stored in the US. Suddenly, launching India is equivalent to migrating the infrastructure to be multi-region. The project is much harder than anticipated. <p>They discovered an “extraordinary blocker”. They need to solve a problem that:</p><ul><li>Seems out of scope for what the project is about: launching a new market is not about big infrastructure migrations.</li><li>Is way bigger than their job description and current skills</li><li>Is unclear if it can be solved in time or at all</li></ul><p>When faced with extraordinary blockers, most people declare defeat and progress stops. Very few people see it as their job to clear the extraordinary blockers, which in this case involves learning about the underlying storage infrastructure.</p><p>The problem of course is that most projects have an extraordinary blocker. Some (milder) examples:</p><ul><li>The new product requires a new pricing scheme which the billing engine, finance, and accounting teams, don't know how to handle. The lieutenant will have to learn enough accounting to translate what is necessary into the current billing system. convincing those teams that the books will be closed in time.</li><li>The new product requires a bold branding campaign that doesn't match the parent company's brand and might be risky (e.g. launching CashApp inside of Square). The lieutenant will have to push through a lot of meetings where people express fear, uncertainty, and doubt in order to not water down the new brand.</li><li>The new product requires employees with new skills (e.g. Zillow hiring ML researchers to price homes). The lieutenant will have to learn about a new field, decide what good looks like, and convince the organization to hire them.</li></ul><p>In all these cases, somebody has to be motivated enough to go beyond their job description. Lieutenants are those that see their job as clearing those “extraordinary blockers” and are effective enough to do it. And in my experience, they are the missing reagent in projects or areas of the company that are stuck.</p><p>“Lieutenants are the limiting reagent” is a subset of Nadia’s observations in <a href="https://nadia.xyz/top-talent">Explaining tech's notion of talent scarcity</a>. I chose the term “lieutenants” instead of “right hands” because “right hands” emphasizes the relationship to some executive, which I find less important, but the notion is the same.</p><h2 id="lieutenants_per_capita">Lieutenants per capita</h2> If lieutenants are the bottleneck, what influences how many lieutenants you have in the first place? What is upstream of having many lieutenants?<p>This is hard to analyze, what makes somebody a lieutenant is context-specific:</p><ul><li>Effectiveness varies over time and by domain. A great sense of style is great for a consumer product, less important for B2B SaaS.</li><li>Motivation changes over time. Somebody that starts motivated, might grow disillusioned.</li><li>Trust is company-specific: an effective person might be trusted in one company and not in another one.</li></ul><p>But here are a few patterns I’ve observed. As companies grow, they have fewer lieutenants per capita:</p><ul><li><strong>Diffuse ownership</strong>: The more people in the team, the more likely you think it is somebody else’s job to solve the extraordinary blocker.</li><li><strong>Diffuse rewards</strong>: And why would you work on the extraordinary blocker? You’ll be equally compensated if you work on the straightforward engineering project you were asked to do. Even if that means the team / company doesn’t hit its goals.</li><li><strong>Bureaucracy</strong>: My intuition is that bureaucracy slows things down but rarely prevents them from happening in the first place. But the more boring and unpleasant it is to get things done, the more likely that people that pride themselves in getting things done leave. So, bureaucracy drives the lieutenants away, which eventually prevents things from happening.</li></ul><h2 id="misc_observations">Misc observations</h2><p>I don’t have a nice conclusion or a recipe to magically solve this problem. Instead, here are some phenomena that are well-explained by “lieutenants are the limiting reagent”:</p><ul><li><strong>Team decay</strong>: Teams go from effective to not effective in a span of a few months. What happened? One or two lieutenants left and now everybody is constantly blocked.</li><li><strong>Fixers and starters</strong>: When I meet somebody from a company I am not familiar with, I ask them for inside stories: how did the last big project go? Surprisingly, a few particular names often come up repeatedly for multiple projects. It is also not uncommon to hear of a "fixer" inside a company: a long-time employee that gets sent to important projects that are not making progress.</li><li><strong>New executives rarely become lieutenants</strong>: CEOs know the limiting reagent is "people I can delegate to". So, they go and hire people that seem to fit the bill: big name executives. But sadly, big name executives rarely translate into lieutenants. Consider the India project. Is the big executive going to read database code to set up an India database replica? No, they will complain that they "were not set up for success" and that "the platform is a mess".<h2></h2></li></ul><p><em>Thanks to Devon Zuegel, Jack Dent, and Lachy Groom for reading drafts and providing feedback.
