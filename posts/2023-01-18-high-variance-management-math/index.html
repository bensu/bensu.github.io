    <p><em>This is a supplement to <a href="/posts/2023-01-18-high-variance-management">high variance management</a>, where I build some intuition on the different probability distributions involved. Please read that post before reading this one.</em></p><h2 id="the_normal_and_gumbel_probability_distributions">The normal and Gumbel probability distributions</h2><p>We can develop some intuitions for these concepts using a simple probability model of Broadway and Hollywood. I'll use Julia to simulate distributions and plot them:</p><pre><code class="julia">using Random, Distributions, Plots
plotly()
Random.seed!(123)
</code></pre><p>Let's assume that the quality of a given take from an actor follows a normal distribution with zero mean and variance of one, <code>Normal(0, 1)</code>. This is a way of modeling the following intuitions:</p><ul><li>Most takes are close to the mean, which we pick to be zero.</li><li>While there are some great takes (with quality higher than 1 or 2), they are rare.</li><li>You get as many bad takes as good takes around the mean (the distribution is symmetric).</li></ul><p>In Broadway, each take <em>is</em> the scene. So, how a scene goes looks like directly sampling from a normal distribution:</p><pre><code class="julia">broadway = Normal(0, 1)
broadway_sample = rand(broadway, 10000)
histogram(broadway_sample, bins=50, label="Broadway")
</code></pre><p><img src="/img/high-variance-management/broadway_normal.png" alt="" /></p><p>In Hollywood, we can do two things differently:</p><ul><li>We encourage actors to take more risks. This makes it more likely that they produce good takes <em>and bad ones</em>. We are going to model this as moving the standard deviation to <code>1.5</code>.</li><li>We do 10 takes (<code>n_takes = 10</code>) and <em>and pick the best one</em> (<code>maximum</code>):<pre><code class="julia">hollywood = Normal(0, 1.5)

n_samples = 10000
n_takes = 10
hollywood_sample = zeros(n_samples)
for i in 1:n_samples
    hollywood_sample[i] = maximum(rand(hollywood, n_takes))
end
histogram!(hollywood_sample, bins=50, label="Hollywood")
</code></pre></li></ul><p>Here is how the new Hollywood distribution compares with the Broadway one:</p><p><img src="/img/high-variance-management/hollywood_broadway_overlayed.png" alt="" /></p><p>According to this toy model, Hollywood's resulting product can be much better:</p><ul><li><strong>Your mean shot is much better</strong>. The Hollywood distribution is centered to the right of 0, with mean at 2.3, more than 2 standard deviations away from Broadway.</li><li><strong>You avoid almost all bad takes</strong>. Almost every Hollywood datapoint is to the right of zero, better than half of Broadway's datapoints. If you take the best of 10, the probability you get a negative number is <code>1/2^10 ≈ 0.1%</code>.</li><li><strong>You get some phenomenal shots</strong>. The Hollywood distribution goes all the way to 5, of which there are almost none in the Broadway distribution.</li></ul><p>You can only do this <em>when you lean into the variance</em>. And you can only do that if there is no cost to bad takes.</p><p>The Hollywood distribution is similar to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gumbel_distribution">Gumbel distribution</a> which approximates taking the maximum of N samples of a normal distribution:</p><pre><code class="julia">function sample_gumbel(distribution, n_samples, n_takes)
    samples = zeros(n_samples)
    for i in 1:n_samples
        samples[i] = maximum(rand(distribution, n_takes))
    end
    return samples
end
</code></pre><h2 id="parameter_sensitivity">Parameter sensitivity</h2><p>When modeling Hollywood, I used two main parameters:</p><ul><li>The number of takes we do before choosing the best one, <code>n_takes = 10</code>.</li><li>The standard deviation that stands for how crazy the actors get, <code>1</code> for Broadway and <code>1.5</code> for Hollywood.</li></ul><p>How does the Hollywood distribution change as we change those two values?</p><p>Starting with <code>n_takes</code>:</p><pre><code class="julia">max_n_takes = 1000
possible_takes = 1:max_n_takes
gumbel_means = zeros(max_n_takes)
for n_takes = possible_takes
    gumbel_means[n_takes] = mean(sample_gumbel(hollywood, n_samples, n_takes))
end

plot(possible_takes, gumbel_means, label="Hollywood mean vs number of takes")
</code></pre><p><img src="/img/high-variance-management/mean_vs_n_takes.png" alt="" /></p><p>As we increase the number of takes, the mean of the Hollywood distribution grows at a logarithmic rate. We get diminishing returns from more and more takes.</p><p>And now for variance, how many different things the actor tries (I'll use the standard deviation instead):</p><pre><code class="julia">n_deviations = 10
deviations = 1:n_deviations
gumbel_mean_by_deviation = zeros(n_deviations)
n_takes = 10
for d = deviations
    distribution = Normal(0, d)
    gumbel_mean_by_deviation[d] = mean(sample_gumbel(distribution, n_samples, n_takes))
end

plot(deviations, gumbel_mean_by_deviation, label="Hollywood mean vs std deviation")
</code></pre><p>We can see how the mean of the Hollywood distribution grows linearly as the "input" standard deviation grows:</p><p><img src="/img/high-variance-management/mean_vs_std_deviation.png" alt="" /></p><p>We get a lot of benefit from having crazy actors. The hope is that if the actors try <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lsFs2615gw">crazier and crazier things</a>, the movies get better and better, even if some of their takes are terrible!</p><h2 id="variance_budget">Variance budget</h2><p>The "increase the variance" argument doesn't only apply to one actor. It applies to every actor in the take.</p><p>But that introduces a problem: assuming that each actor's performance is decorrelated from the others, the more actors on screen, the more unlikely that they'll all have a great shot at the same time. If you have <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXlHKTPfLVA">12 actors in one shot</a>, the probability that they'll have an above average shot is <code>1/2^12 ≈ 0.024%</code><a href="#fn-1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>. You'll need a lot of shots just to get something decent.</p><p>If the quality of a shot is determined by the <em>worst</em> actor in the shot (i.e. <code>minimum</code>), then you are guaranteed to do worse the more actors you add:</p><pre><code class="julia">max_n_actors = 10
actors = 1:max_n_actors
gumbel_mean_by_actors = zeros(max_n_actors)
n_takes = 10
n_samples = 1000
for n_actors = actors
    samples = zeros(n_samples)
    for s = 1:n_samples
        takes = zeros(n_takes)
        for t = 1:n_takes
            takes[t] = minimum(rand(hollywood, n_actors))
        end
        samples[s] = maximum(takes)
    end
    gumbel_mean_by_actors[n_actors] = mean(samples)
end

plot(actors, gumbel_mean_by_actors, label="Hollywood mean vs n actors")
</code></pre><p>You can see the mean shot getting worse and worse. In this case, variance is now your enemy:</p><p><img src="/img/high-variance-management/mean_vs_n_actors.png" alt="" /></p><p>Given that a software project can be ruined by a faulty part, it makes sense to have a variance budget<a href="#fn-2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> that you should spend carefully, and only on factors that will multiply the final product.</p><p><br /></p><h2 id="footnotes">Footnotes</h2><ol class="footnotes"><li id="fn-1">This and other "curses of dimensionality" are well-covered in chapter 9 of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Art-Doing-Science-Engineering-Learning/dp/1732265178/">The Art of Science and Engineering</a>.<a href="#fnref1">↩</a></li><li id="fn-2">I remember reading a blogpost with a term like "innovation chips" that described this, but for picking components in a technology stack ("You only get three chips").
