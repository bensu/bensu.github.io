    <p>We read what people are thinking all the time. We rarely meet the flesh-and-bone person behind it. Every time I met someone I'd read before, I understood their writing much better: </p><p>In most cases, their ideas are directly coming from from their personality. Autocratic ideas? An autocratic personality. Pessimistic ideas? A pessimistic person. When I say it this way, it sounds obvious. But I still haven't fully integrated what this means.</p><p>When you read a careful argument of how X is ruined, it often reads like the writer started with some neutral facts and then reached an inescapable conclusion. But then you meet them IRL you realize they think <i>everything</i> is ruined. No facts or arguments necessary.</p><p>This is one way in which podcasts help: </p><ul><li>Because they are conversational, they cover more topics. You can see what their default stance is as the conversation goes to topics outside of the speaker's comfort zone.</li><li>You can pick up on their tone and language to see the personality.</li></ul><p>But still, even then, I've been surprised when meeting people face-to-face. I always learn more! The things they find funny, the way they talk to a waiter, whether the let others talk, etc. You only get those readings in private settings. I've always been surprised <em>in some way</em> after meeting an author.</p><p>Internalizing this point makes it harder to trust older texts. Here some tragicomical examples:</p><ul><li>David Foster Wallace wrote about personal responsibility and ethics. DFW that committed suicide and was accused of extreme violent abuse by his partner.</li><li>Karl Marx talked about the struggles of the worker but he never worked a day in his life. He lived from inheritance and the largesse from his wealthy friends.</li><li>Rousseau talked about Natural Goodness and an innate moral conscience. He also talked about what constituted a proper moral education for children. He also abandoned five children to die in the hospital they were born.</li></ul><p>This is not to <em>entirely</em> dismiss them. I take elements from each of them seriously! Somebody can be a monster and inspire at the same time. I can ignore Rousseau's Emile and read The Social Contract. Nobody is perfect and I don't expect moral perfection. But the the authoritative voice fades in the background when you meet the author, even if it is by reading their biography or listening to their podcast.</p>
